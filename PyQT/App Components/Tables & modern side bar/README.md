## Description
Simple component to sort data from dictionary (we assumed that our database is parsed into the code as a dictionary) and display this dictionary on table. No interaction with the application.

Added:
- modern UI side bar with gradient color using stylesheet and round corners.
- Table, added **smooth scrolling** (normally it is rough transition in QT designer tables)
